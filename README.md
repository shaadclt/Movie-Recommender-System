# Movie Recommender System

A movie recommendation system is a system whose objective is to predict and compile a list of movies that a user is likely to watch. Recommendation systems have gained much popularity in recent years and have been developed and implemented for various commercial use cases.

For example,

Netflix uses recommendation systems to recommend movies or television programs for individual users
Amazon uses recommendation systems to predict and display a list of products that the customer is likely to buy
Spotify uses music recommendation systems to provide new songs for its listeners
Recommendation systems have a strong potentional to be used in a variery of other areas as well, however they play a major role in the e-commerce and media businesses, as they can directly impact the revenue and user engagement

There are broadly 3 types of recommendation systems:

Popularity Based: This is a basic system in which movies/shows which are rated high will be recommended to all the users in a certain demographic region. Eg: Netflix Top Trending will show top 10 movies trending in that particular country to ever user.

Content Based: The general idea is that if a user liked an item with certain properites then he/she are more likely to like similar items. Eg: Movies are recommended based on they Cast, Story, Genre, Plot, Director and many more fields.

Collaborative Filtering: This is a more advanced system in which the algorithm tries to find similar users/articles and then recommends items based on this similarity. Eg: If one person likes movies A, B, and C and another person likes movies A, B, and D, it is likely that the first person will buy item D and the other person will buy item C, since they share many similarities with each other
